nvcc helloworld.cu -gencode arch=compute_52,code=sm_52 -o helloworld


-code=sm_35 : produces binary code (cubin object) for devices of compute capability 3.5
Binary compatibility is guaranteed from one minor revision to the next one,
but NOT from one minor revision to the previous one or across major revisions.
X.y will run on devices with compute capability X.z where z>=y.

nvcc x.cu
        -gencode arch=compute_20,code=sm_20
        -gencode arch=compute_30,code=sm_30
        -gencode arch=compute_35,code=\'compute_35,sm_35\'

Host code is generated to automatically select at runtime the most appropriate
code to load and execute, which, in the above example, will be:

    2.0 binary code for devices with compute capability 2.0 and 2.1,
    3.0 binary code for devices with compute capability 3.0,
    3.5 binary code for devices with compute capability 3.5 and higher 3.x,
    binary code obtained by compiling 3.5 PTX code for devices with compute
capabilities 3.5 and higher.
